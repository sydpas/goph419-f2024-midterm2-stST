b)

What are the requirements for the iterative Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi iteration techniques to converge?
- diagonal dominance indicates convergence of the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods.
- the coefficient matrix should be symmetric.
- a good initial guess will allow for quicker convergence but is not required.

Does the coefficient matrix in a) satisfy these conditions?
- the matrix is diagonally dominant because each diagonal element is larger in absolute value than the sum of the
non-diagonal elements.
- the coefficient matrix is symmetric.

Is it guaranteed to converge?
- no because the coefficient matrix is not strictly diagonally dominant.

Is it possible to converge?
- Yes. it is still diagonally dominant, but its chances of convergence are less than if it was 100% diagonally dominant.


e)

Are the results in d) an accurate representation of CO2 concentration in March of 2015?
Yes, this result is an accurate representation. The spline is fairly linear and shows a steady rate of increase without
sharp changes that would indicate a deviation of data.
